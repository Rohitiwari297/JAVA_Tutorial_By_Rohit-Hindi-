Conditionals:
    1-ifElse_Condition:
        1- if/else  - Normal
        2- if-else-if-else - Nested Conditionals 
        3- if-else - Multi Conditionals (reconmended)
    2-Switch Case:
        1- switch( condition ) {
            case: 1
                execution code if CASE IS TRUE;
                break;  //<- if condition is true then break code is from here
                                if you can't use BREAK then execute all code which is exist in bellow of truthy condition.
            case: 2
                 execution code if CASE IS TRUE;
                 break;
            default:
                execution code if all condition is false;
                break;
        }

        NOTE: Possible type accepted:
            - integers {int, shor, byte, long}
            - string
            - wrapper classes
            - enums

Loops: 
    1- for-Loop
        Q- print all the even nums b/w 0-10
        NOTE: 1-    continue-> 
                        - Next line are skipped
                        - go to the next iteration
              2-    break ->
                        - terminate the toop

    2- Nested Loop: 
            - loop inside another loop
    2- while-loop
